      <description>In this post we will be looking at two of my favorite projects from a class that I have really been enjoying recently, Networks and Distributed Systems!
The first project we will be looking at is a simplified virtual BGP router. The professors provided us with a simulator and several configs, in which the router we built must be ran against and pass in correctness and performance. Responsibilities of the router included accepting route announcements from simulated peer routers, generating new route announcements for peer routers, managing and compressing forwarding tables, calculating optimal routes, and forwarding data packets that arrive from simulated internet users.</description>

      <description>This is a web app, built with Python and the Django framework, using HTML/CSS and Bootstrap for the front end. My friends and I love taking quizzes and asking each other questions to either get to know each other better or challenge each other&amp;rsquo;s knowledge of various topics, so I decided to make a web app so we would a place to make whatever quizzes we wanted and send them to each other.</description>

      <title>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Tournament Simulator</title>

      <description>My latest project that I started developing over last Winter Break is an app that uses a database of tournamnet results for Smash Ultimate pro players to simulate games between them. Using a combination, of player head-to-head history, player winrate, how highly ranked the characte they play is in the meta, character matchup charts, the program tries to predict who would win between two players. So using this algorithm, users of the app will be able to make tournament brackets as big as top 16s with professional players and the program will simulate the bracket.</description>

      <description>So far in my journey with CS at Northeastern, I have completed a few different projects, a couple being interesting enough that I would like to highlight them here and briefly discuss them.
The first project I will be talking about is the Marble Solitaire project. For those that don&amp;rsquo;t know, marble solitaire is a simple board game where you try to hop marbles over each other to eliminate them, the goal is to be left with one marble at the end.</description>
