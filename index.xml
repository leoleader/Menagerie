      <description>GitHub Repo Check out NER! 3/29 - Argos Dev Update Argos is one part of a much greater Odyssey of data, comprising of many different programs and technologies, which is laid out in detail in the flow chart below.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a short set of descriptions of all the main technologies used in the Odyssey.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown of Argos.
Argos is now both an IOS app and Web App! Here&amp;rsquo;s a look at a test video I made of some of the functionality for the IOS app.</description>

      <description>This is a piano cover of Bleached by Video Days I made, the first music video I&amp;rsquo;ve ever made.
This song reminds me of the feeling of watching old home videos, so I edited together a compilation of some of my own home videos and think it came together really nicely.

      <description>Check out the Repo! Have you ever dreamed of becoming a Tetris Master? Well now you can live that dream with BlockBot!
BlockBot is a Tetris AI that is able to continuously analyze the state of the game to make optimal decisions and play the game faster than a human! Ever since I was a kid I have always been fascinated by AI in games, specifically the level 9 CPUs in the Smash Brother series since they were consistently able to beat me, and have always wanted to develop AI of my own.</description>

      <description>Sherry&amp;rsquo;s Quizzes is a quiz taking/building web app that I developed, check it out at https://sherrysquizzes-6d15ee4bcb35.herokuapp.com ! Sherry is built in Python with Django as the backend, SQLite database and HTML/CSS as the frontend, hosted on Heroku.
NOTE: I realized on deployment that Django/Heroku is lowkey lame when it comes to serving static files so currently user uploaded images are not displaying until I set up a custom file storage backend w a CDN.</description>

      <description>In this post we will be looking at two of my favorite projects from a class that I have really been enjoying recently, Networks and Distributed Systems!
The first project we will be looking at is a simplified virtual BGP router. The professors provided us with a simulator and several configs, in which the router we built must be ran against and pass in correctness and performance. Responsibilities of the router included accepting route announcements from simulated peer routers, generating new route announcements for peer routers, managing and compressing forwarding tables, calculating optimal routes, and forwarding data packets that arrive from simulated internet users.</description>

      <description>McCann&amp;rsquo;s URL Shotener is pretty self-explanatory, Typescript React web app that takes a given long url and shortens it for the user. I built this in a couple days to get experience working with Typesript, React, Express, and testing with Cypress and Jest. I used Chakra UI to use custom fonts, colors, images and other UI stylings.
Locally home page looks like this:

      <description>So far in my journey with CS at Northeastern, I have completed a few different projects, a couple being interesting enough that I would like to highlight them here and briefly discuss them.
The first project I will be talking about is the Marble Solitaire project. For those that don&amp;rsquo;t know, marble solitaire is a simple board game where you try to hop marbles over each other to eliminate them, the goal is to be left with one marble at the end.</description>

      <description>These are some of my favorite poems I have written over the years, the first one winning a Scholastic Writing Award which was quite exciting. I like to write in my free time and have dozens of different poems and hope that as time goes on I write many more.

      <description>Ever since I was a kid I have always had a persisting passion and intense curiosity for a variety of different subjects. As the years went on, my thirst for endless knowledge of everything and anything matured and honed in on three special subjects: programming, writing, and music. Performing as a lead violist in the New Jersey Youth Symphony and playing waltzes on the piano for friends and family, music has always been and forever will be a huge part of my life.</description>
