Ever since I was a kid I have always had a persisting passion and intense curiosity for a variety of different subjects. As the years went on, my thirst for endless knowledge of everything and anything matured and honed in on three special subjects: programming, writing, and music. 

</p>
<p>Performing as a lead violist in the New Jersey Youth Symphony and playing waltzes on the piano for friends and family, music has always been and forever will be a huge part of my life. It is rare to see me without my headphones while I am studying or while I am running in the wee hours of the morning, and I am constantly looking for new genres of music to explore. I love to do covers and arrangments of songs and sometimes even compose my own pieces, which I will be posting on this website from time to time.</p>
<p>Humans have been telling stories for centuries upon centuries, our stories always taking new, vibrant shapes as the mediums and processes of delivering them continually evolve. I have always loved the art of the written word and have written many poems, short stories, and other works in my spare time. Now I am taking my first crack at a much bigger story in the form of a visual novel game which I am super excited about. Details about the game and some of my written work will be posted in the future :)</p>
<p>Finally, the newest and most exciting, COMPUTER SCIENCE! I started out making silly animations and games with Scratch and Greenfoot in middle school. Then during high school I danced with physics and engineering, learning AutoCAD and building model bridges, before coming back to the world of computer science with a introductory Python class in senior year. This was when everything began to click and I realized that I really loved computer science. Going off to Northeastern University, I declared my major as Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics and have been advancing my technological prowess ever since. If you want to check out some of the projects I have done, visit the Projects tab above.</p>
