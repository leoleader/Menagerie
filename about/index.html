Ever since I was a kid I have always had a persisting passion and intense curiosity for a variety of different subjects. As the years went on, my thirst for endless knowledge of everything and anything matured and honed in on three special subjects: programming, writing, and music. 

</p>
<p>Performing as a lead violist in the New Jersey Youth Symphony and playing waltzes on the piano for friends and family, music has always been and forever will be a huge part of my life. It is rare to see me without my headphones while I am studying or while I am running in the wee hours of the morning, and I am constantly looking for new genres of music to explore. I love to do covers and arrangments of songs and sometimes even compose my own pieces, which I will be posting on this website from time to time.</p>
<p>Humans have been telling stories for centuries upon centuries, our stories always taking new, vibrant shapes as the mediums and processes of delivering them continually evolve. I have always loved the art of the written word and have written many poems, short stories, and other works in my spare time.</p>
<p>Finally, the newest and most exciting, COMPUTER SCIENCE! I started out making silly animations and games with Scratch and Greenfoot in middle school. Then during high school I danced with physics and engineering, learning AutoCAD and building model bridges, before coming back to the world of computer science with an introductory Python class in senior year. This was when everything began to click and I realized that I really loved computer science. Going off to Northeastern University, I declared my major as Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics and have been advancing my technological prowess ever since. If you want to check out some of the projects I have done, visit the Projects tab above.</p>
