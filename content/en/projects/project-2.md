McCann's URL Shotener is pretty self-explanatory, Typescript React web app that takes a given long url and shortens it for the user. I built this in a couple days to get experience working with Typesript, React, Express, and testing with Cypress and Jest. I used Chakra UI to use custom fonts, colors, images and other UI stylings. 

Locally home page looks like this:
{{< url >}}
