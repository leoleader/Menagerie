You can check out the development and how it&amp;rsquo;s going at my Github, https://github.com/leoleader</description>

      <description>These are some of my favorite poems I have written over the years, the first one winning a Scholastic Writing Award which was quite exciting. I like to write in my free time and have dozens of different poems and hope that as time goes on I write many more.
